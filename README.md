# Quire!

Quire is an Note application build with Kotlin Jetpack Compose(native Android app).

You can write notes, edit notes, delete notes and mark them as favorit, search a note and more.

Room data is used for storing the user data (see Data base package).

Navgraph is used for navigating in the app (see Navgraph package).

The app is developed by a team (group work).
In our project, we have chosen to combine three different agile methodologies: Scrum, Kanban, and XP. It was beneficial to use different methods together as it provided more flexibility and adaptability. Each method had its own advantages that helped us improve our work. By using a Kanban board (Trello), we could have better visibility of our workflow and see what tasks needed to be done. With Scrum, we had short sprints and daily stand-up meetings to plan and prioritize our work, which helped us stay organized. By incorporating XP, especially pair programming, mob programming, and code reviews (parprogrammering, mobbprogrammering och kodgranskning), we were able to enhance the quality of our code and collaborate better by working together and reviewing each other's code.
